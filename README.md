# Shapefiles

This is an open repo where I aggregate and store shapefiles I use for projects in my other repos.  Typically I will copy the shapefiles in question to appropriate repo so as to maintain a contained project, but have a master shapefile repo facilitates reuse of shapefiles in other projects.

## Word of Caution

I am no expert in spatial analysis, but a word of warning to the uninitiated--always protect the integrity of the entire folder containing the shapefiles.  You may think it would be easier to just download the .shp file (I've made this mistake), but in fact there are dependencies linked to the other folders.  So basically, you'll break everything if you don't keep all the files under the same folder.
