# Shapefiles

This is an open repo where I aggregate and store shapefiles I use for projects in my other repos.  Typically I will copy the shapefiles in question to appropriate repo so as to maintain a contained project, but have a master shapefile repo facilitates reuse of shapefiles in other projects.
